  title: Serrano Hypermedia API
  description: Harvest REST API used by e.g. Cilantro and built on top of e.g. Avocado
  version: "2.4.5"
# There is no public service, but if there were, it would be defined with `host`.
# Demo host:
# host: harvest.research.chop.edu
# array of all schemes that your API supports
schemes:
  - http
  - https
# For demo purposes, `basePath` will be prefixed to all paths
# TODO: versioning the API and requiring/expecting a version path prefix might be a good idea
# basePath: /demo/api
produces:
  - application/json

        The root endpoint returns the name and version of the API.
        **TODO**: Swagger has a conventional Info object also including description,
        terms of service, etc, which is a superset of the current payload object.

        Posting to the root endpoint produces an authentication token
        in the response. By default, Serrano does not require authentication
        (SERRANO_AUTH_REQUIRED is False), and in many current installations,
        the Serrano API is protected by the encompassing application.
